  "recommendations": [
    "Geographic weight should be increased (current: 0.15) - VA dominates with 35 profiles",
    "Financial fit scoring needs refinement - wide revenue range detected",
    "Eligibility weight should be increased (current: 0.25) - high focus area diversity requires better filtering",
    "Timing weight (current: 0.20) appears well-balanced for current data patterns",
    "Historical success weight may be too high (current: 0.20) - limited historical data available"
