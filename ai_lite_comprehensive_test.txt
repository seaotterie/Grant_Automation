COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH MISSION:
CRITICAL: You MUST conduct actual web research for each organization. This is not a creative writing exercise - you need to investigate the real websites, programs, and funding opportunities.

REQUIRED RESEARCH STEPS for each opportunity:
1. VISIT THE WEBSITE - Go to the provided website and examine their actual grant programs
2. FIND SPECIFIC PROGRAMS - Look for technology, digital equity, workforce, broadband, STEM, or senior programs
3. EXTRACT REAL DATA - Get actual funding amounts, deadlines, requirements from their materials
4. IDENTIFY CONTACTS - Find real program officer names, emails, phone numbers
5. ANALYZE ELIGIBILITY - Review their actual eligibility requirements against our profile
6. ASSESS COMPETITION - Research their typical grantees and funding patterns
7. GATHER INTELLIGENCE - Collect actionable information that grant teams can use immediately

DO NOT MAKE UP INFORMATION. If you cannot access a website or find specific details, clearly state "Unable to verify" or "Website not accessible" rather than creating fictional content.

For each opportunity, conduct thorough research and provide analysis in EXACT JSON format:

   - Eligibility requirements as stated in their guidelines

2. PROGRAM ANALYSIS: Research their actual funding programs:
   - Current grant opportunities that match our focus areas
   - Historical grant awards and recipient organizations  
   - Program priorities and funding criteria from their materials
   - Application materials, forms, and submission requirements

3. CONTACT INTELLIGENCE: Find real contact information:
   - Program officer names and titles from staff directories
   - Direct email addresses and phone numbers
   - Administrative contacts for application support
   - Regional representatives if applicable

4. COMPETITIVE RESEARCH: Investigate their actual grantee base:
