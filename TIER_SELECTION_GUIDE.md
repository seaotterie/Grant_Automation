$100,000 - $500,000            Enhanced Intelligence
$500,000+                      Complete Intelligence

Strategic Value                 Recommended Tier
Routine/Operational            Current Intelligence
Important/Growth               Standard Intelligence
Critical/Strategic             Enhanced Intelligence

Some connections helpful       Standard or Enhanced
Relationships critical         Enhanced or Complete
Network strategy required      Complete Intelligence
```

#### **Timeline Considerations**
```
Decision Timeline              Recommended Tier

### 💰 **Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework**

#### **ROI Calculation**
```python
def calculate_tier_roi(opportunity_value: float, tier_cost: float, success_probability: float) -> float:
    """Calculate return on investment for tier selection"""
    
    expected_value = opportunity_value * success_probability
    roi = (expected_value - tier_cost) / tier_cost
    
    return roi

# Example calculations:
# $50K opportunity, 75% success probability:
# Current tier: ($50K * 0.75 - $0.75) / $0.75 = 49,900% ROI
# Standard tier: ($50K * 0.80 - $7.50) / $7.50 = 5,227% ROI  
# Enhanced tier: ($50K * 0.85 - $22.00) / $22.00 = 1,832% ROI
```

#### **Cost-Effectiveness Thresholds**
```
Opportunity Value    Current    Standard    Enhanced    Complete
$5,000              ✅ 6,567%   ❌ 433%     ❌ 91%      ❌ 18%
$25,000             ✅ 32,900%  ✅ 2,567%   ✅ 864%     ✅ 452%
$100,000            ✅ 131,900% ✅ 10,567%  ✅ 3,727%   ✅ 1,952%
$500,000            ✅ 659,900% ✅ 52,567%  ✅ 18,614%  ✅ 9,810%

✅ = Cost-effective (>1000% ROI)
⚠️ = Marginal (100-1000% ROI)  
❌ = Not cost-effective (<100% ROI)
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### 🚨 **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **Processing Failures**
```
Issue: Tier processing timeout
Cause: Complex analysis exceeding time limits
Solution: 
1. Check opportunity complexity score
2. Consider tier downgrade for time-sensitive needs
3. Use async processing with status monitoring
4. Contact support for complex opportunity optimization

Issue: Insufficient analysis quality
Cause: Data limitations or processing errors
Solution:
1. Validate input data quality
2. Check entity cache for missing information  
3. Consider tier upgrade for enhanced analysis
4. Review opportunity data sources
```

#### **Cost Management Issues**
```
Issue: Unexpected high costs
Cause: Over-utilization of expensive tiers
Solution:
1. Review tier selection criteria
2. Implement budget constraints
3. Use tier recommendation engine
4. Monitor monthly usage patterns

Issue: Poor ROI on tier selection
Cause: Tier over-analysis or under-analysis
Solution:
1. Use tier selection decision framework
2. Implement ROI validation before processing
3. Track success rates and adjust criteria
4. Consider hybrid tab processor approach
```

#### **Performance Issues**
```
Issue: Slow tier processing
Cause: Cache misses or resource constraints
Solution:
1. Check entity cache hit rates
2. Optimize tier processing order
3. Use parallel processing for independent components
4. Monitor system resource usage

Issue: Quality inconsistencies
Cause: Variable data quality or processing errors
Solution:
1. Implement pre-processing validation
2. Use confidence score thresholds
3. Enable fallback processing modes
4. Track quality metrics over time
