TASK - PLAN TAB (Comprehensive Strategic Intelligence):
You are conducting comprehensive opportunity screening and strategic assessment as described in the AI_PROCESSOR_TAB_GUIDE. This analysis must cover ALL 15 capability areas with detailed intelligence.

REQUIRED ANALYSIS AREAS:

1. FUNDING SOURCE VERIFICATION:
   - Assess DOE as legitimate federal funder with confirmed funding capacity
   - Determine if this is direct funding, fiscal sponsor, aggregator, or service provider
   - Evaluate funding provider reliability and classification confidence (0.0-1.0)
   - Verify actual grant-making vs information aggregation

2. PROGRAM STATUS INTELLIGENCE:
   - Evaluate current program status (active/seasonal/archived/ambiguous)
   - Assess if program is currently accepting applications
   - Analyze application timeline and deadline proximity
   - Determine seasonal patterns or cyclical nature

3. ELIGIBILITY PRE-SCREENING:
   - Parse comprehensive qualification criteria
   - Assess organizational fit (entity type, status, structure)
   - Evaluate geographic compliance and location-based restrictions
   - Analyze financial thresholds and capacity requirements
   - Identify requirement gaps and potential solutions

4. STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK:
   - Mission alignment scoring using NLP-powered semantic analysis (0.0-1.0)
   - Strategic value classification (Exceptional/High/Medium/Low/Minimal Value)
   - Priority mapping between nonprofit and funder objectives
   - Geographic scope compatibility analysis
   - Contextual understanding of organizational mission fit

5. RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX (All 6 Categories):
   - Competition Risk: competitive pressure and application volume assessment
   - Technical Requirements: specialized requirement complexity evaluation
   - Geographic Constraints: location-based restrictions and compliance
   - Capacity Limitations: organizational capability and resource gaps
   - Timeline Pressures: deadline constraints and preparation requirements
   - Compliance Complexity: regulatory and administrative burden

6. ENHANCED WEB INTELLIGENCE:
   - Extract and analyze contact information (program officers, departments)
   - Assess application process complexity (simple/moderate/complex)
   - Map step-by-step application workflow and requirements
   - Identify critical success factors for application completion

7. BATCH PROCESSING INTELLIGENCE:
   - Assign batch priority score (0.0-1.0) for processing optimization
   - Recommend processing approach (immediate/batched/deferred)
   - Suggest optimal batch grouping with similar opportunities
   - Calculate resource allocation weight as percentage of total effort

8. QUALITY ASSURANCE SCORING:
   - Evaluate data completeness score (0.0-1.0) for input information
   - Assess analysis reliability score (0.0-1.0) for confidence in findings
   - Identify missing data gaps and their impact on analysis accuracy
   - Recommend specific additional data needed for quality improvement

9. DOWNSTREAM INTEGRATION:
   - Assess readiness for next stage analysis (ready/needs_data/skip)
   - Evaluate quality gate status (pass/conditional/fail) for ANALYZE tab
   - Prepare data package requirements for ANALYZE tab processing
   - Recommend optimal processing path (standard/expedited/enhanced)

10. SUCCESS FACTOR MODELING:
    - Calculate statistical success probability (0.0-1.0) based on analysis
    - Identify and rank top 5 critical success factors
    - Assess top 3 failure risk factors and mitigation strategies
    - Recommend specific optimization opportunities for success improvement

11. COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE:
    - Assess competitive pressure level (low/medium/high)
    - Identify likely competing organizations and organization types
    - Analyze nonprofit's unique competitive advantages and differentiators
    - Recommend differentiation strategy and positioning approach

12. RELATIONSHIP MAPPING:
    - Analyze board network connections and potential pathways
    - Identify strategic partnership and collaboration opportunities
    - Map introduction pathways to key decision makers and contacts
    - Calculate relationship leverage score (0.0-1.0) for existing connections
