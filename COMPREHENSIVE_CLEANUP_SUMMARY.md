## 🏗️ Improved Project Structure

### Before Cleanup (Cluttered)
```
/ (root with 50+ mixed files)
├── archived_streamlit_components/
├── OriginalScripts/
├── data_backup*/
├── Multiple *.bat files
├── Multiple *.html demo files
├── 20+ *.md files scattered
├── test_*.py files everywhere
└── Hundreds of cache/temp files
```

### After Cleanup (Organized)
```
/ (clean root directory)
├── archive/OriginalScripts/
├── docs/
│   ├── active documentation
│   └── archive/ (historical reports)
├── scripts/
│   ├── export/ (export utilities)
│   └── utils/ (cleanup & migration)
├── src/ (unchanged core architecture)
├── data/ (optimized structure)
└── Essential core files only
```
