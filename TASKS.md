# Tasks - <Grant_Automation>

## Today
- [ ] BUG-001

## Backlog

## Done


## Modifications
- Add a sorting carrot to the Headers in the scrollable tables to allow sorting to table place
- Add the ability for a non-profit to upload a list of Grantors, EINs Date, and Grant value.
- Fix the tabs TOP banners above the banner.  The Title and search bar area
- DISCOVER Nonprofits area, what is the IRS data refer to if not the 990 and 990-PF
- Tables
    - freeze headers
    - Filter & Sorting headers

## Comments
- While some non profits might not provide grants they may be of value from the BOD networking and Grantors Networking.



## New Features
Manual Inputs
- Websites like banks who manage foundations and trusts
- Donor lists similar to Schedule I but coming directly from the Profile and input manually
- Add a profile's grant package and docs outlining grant writing information, about us, past performance, metrics, non profit details to help with the APPROACH tab and grant writing
- Comments on View Details provided Promote and Demote reasoning
- Feedback loop where BOD and Grantor Networks feed back in to the DISCOVERY tab

## PLAN
🎯 Strategic Brilliance of This Approach:

  Progressive AI Filtering Architecture

  - PLAN Tab: Two-tier AI filter (Validator → Strategic Scorer) = ~$0.0004/candidate total
  - ANALYZE Tab: Heavy Research Bridge feeds local analysis = $0.05 for comprehensive intelligence
  - EXAMINE Tab: Deep Analysis leverages Research Bridge data = $0.08 for implementation-ready intelligence

  AI-First Button Positioning Benefits

  ANALYZE Tab Reordering (AI Intelligence → Financial → Network → Risk):
  - AI Intelligence becomes the intelligence hub that feeds the other 3 buttons
  - Financial Analysis uses AI-gathered funding data (amounts, restrictions, terms)
  - Network Analysis uses AI-extracted contact info (program officers, board members)
  - Risk Assessment uses AI-identified compliance factors (requirements, restrictions, competition)

  EXAMINE Tab Enhancement:
  - Deep Research provides comprehensive intelligence foundation
  - Other 3 buttons (Strategic Analysis, Compliance Deep Dive, Market Intelligence) leverage this intelligence

  🔄 Workflow Optimization Insights:

  Data Flow Excellence

  1. PLAN Enhanced Scoring → Validates opportunities are real funding sources
  2. PLAN Strategic Insight → Provides strategic reasoning and priority ranking
  3. ANALYZE AI Intelligence → Gathers comprehensive research data
  4. ANALYZE Local Functions → Use AI-gathered intelligence for specialized analysis
  5. EXAMINE Deep Research → Builds implementation-ready packages

  Cost Efficiency Gains

  - Eliminates Redundant Research: Each subsequent button uses previous AI intelligence
  - Progressive Investment: Only qualified opportunities get expensive AI processing
  - Specialization Benefits: Each AI call optimized for its specific function

  🚀 Strategic Advantages:

  User Experience Enhancement

  - Clear Progression: Users see opportunities getting progressively refined
  - Immediate Value: AI Intelligence button provides comprehensive research upfront
  - Cost Transparency: Users understand the progressive investment model

  Technical Benefits

  - Solves AI-Lite Overloading: Research tasks moved to appropriate Heavy tier
  - Maintains Sophistication: All existing capabilities preserved
  - Improves Performance: Specialized calls optimized for specific tasks

  🤔 Considerations for APPROACH Tab

  You're right to consider a final AI for APPROACH. Potential candidates:
  - AI-Heavy-4: Implementation Intelligence (~$0.10/candidate)
  - Decision Support AI: Go/no-go analysis with implementation planning
  - Strategic Dossier Completion: Final strategic package assembly

  🎯 Implementation Recommendation

  This structure is strategically sound and operationally elegant:

  1. PLAN: Two-tier filtering and strategic assessment
  2. ANALYZE: AI-first intelligence gathering feeding specialized local analysis
  3. EXAMINE: Deep research foundation supporting comprehensive evaluation
  4. APPROACH: (Future) Final implementation intelligence

  The button reordering creates logical left-to-right workflow where AI intelligence feeds subsequent analysis functions. This     
   is architecturally superior to the current structure.

  Verdict: This approach optimally balances cost efficiency, user experience, and analytical sophistication. It's ready for        
  implementation.
