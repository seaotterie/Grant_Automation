- Consolidate scattered functionality into workflow-appropriate stages
- Enable systematic testing of complete nonprofit research workflows
- Maintain all existing processor functionality with improved organization

RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Phase 1: Implement 5-stage workflow interface (Profiler → Discover → Analyze → Plan → Execute)
- Phase 2: Consolidate existing tabs into appropriate workflow stages
- Phase 3: Optimize interface based on workflow testing results

IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE:
- This document provides planning guidance for GUI reorganization only
- No existing code modifications during planning phase
- Focus on interface improvements that support workflow validation
- Future code refactoring will be separate implementation effort

WORKFLOW TESTING BENEFITS:
- End-to-end nonprofit research process validation
- Clear progression from profile creation through execution
- Better user experience for nonprofit audiences watching workflows
- Systematic approach to identifying interface improvements
- Foundation for future performance optimizations

This inventory provides the foundation for workflow-based GUI optimization while preserving all sophisticated analytical capabilities that make Catalynx effective for nonprofit grant research.
