# 🕸️ Interactive Network Visualization Guide

## 🎯 **What You Now Have**

### **Enhanced Interactive Features:**

#### **1. Main Network Graph (catalynx_demo_network.html)**
- **Spider web layout** with organizations as nodes
- **Connection lines** showing shared board members
- **Color coding** by NTEE codes (Health=Blue, Food=Purple, Foundations=Gold)
- **Node sizes** reflect network centrality and influence
- **Board member labels** on connection lines

#### **2. Influence Network Graph (catalynx_demo_influence.html)** ⚡ NEW!
- **Concentric circles** - high influence members in center
- **Connection lines** between people who share organizations
- **3 influence tiers**: Center (8+ score), Middle (3-8 score), Outer (< 3 score)
- **Color coding**: Red = Super-connectors (4+ boards), Orange = Multi-board (2-3), Blue = Single board

## 🎮 **Navigation Controls**

### **🔍 Zoom Controls:**
- **Mouse wheel UP** = Zoom in (get closer view)
- **Mouse wheel DOWN** = Zoom out (see big picture)
- **Double-click** anywhere = Reset to original zoom level
- **Toolbar zoom buttons** = Precise zoom controls

### **🖱️ Pan Controls:**
- **Click and drag** empty space = Move around the network
- **Click and drag** works in any direction
- **Pan while zoomed** = Explore different parts of network

### **📱 Toolbar Features (Top of graph):**
- **🏠 Home icon** = Reset zoom and position
- **🔍+ icon** = Zoom in
- **🔍- icon** = Zoom out  
- **📦 Box select** = Select area to zoom
- **↔️ Pan** = Toggle pan mode
- **💾 Download** = Save image as PNG

### **ℹ️ Information Display:**
- **Hover over nodes** = Detailed organization/person info popup
- **Hover over lines** = Connection details and shared members
- **Stay still for 1 second** = Info appears
- **Move mouse away** = Info disappears

## 🎨 **Visual Legend**

### **Main Network Graph:**
```
🔵 Blue circles = Health organizations (E32, E21, E60, E86)
🟣 Purple circles = Food organizations (F30, F32)
🟡 Gold circles = Foundations (T31, P81)
⚪ Gray circles = Other/Unknown NTEE codes

Line thickness = Connection strength (more shared members = thicker)
Node size = Network centrality (bridge organizations = larger)
```

### **Influence Network:**
```
🔴 Red circles = Super-connectors (4+ board positions)
🟠 Orange circles = Multi-board members (2-3 positions)  
🔵 Blue circles = Single board members (1 position)

Position rings = Influence level (center = highest influence)
Node size = Total influence score
Gray lines = Shared organization connections
```

## 🚀 **Advanced Navigation Tips**

### **Exploration Workflow:**
1. **Start zoomed out** - See the full network structure
2. **Zoom into clusters** - Focus on tight connection groups
3. **Hover for details** - Get specific organization/person info
4. **Follow connection lines** - Trace board member relationships
5. **Double-click to reset** - Return to overview

### **Strategic Analysis:**
1. **Identify network hubs** - Largest nodes with most connections
2. **Find bridge organizations** - Nodes connecting different clusters
3. **Trace influence paths** - Follow high-influence members across orgs
4. **Spot collaboration opportunities** - Organizations with strong connections

## 📍 **File Locations**

## 🎯 **What to Look For**

### **In Main Network:**
- **Central organizations** = Key partnership targets
- **Thick connection lines** = Strong board overlap
- **Isolated nodes** = Organizations needing relationship building
- **Color clusters** = Sector-based collaboration opportunities

### **In Influence Network:**
- **Center positions** = Key influencers to approach
- **Dense connection areas** = Tight network clusters
- **Bridge positions** = People connecting different groups
- **Large red nodes** = Super-connectors worth cultivating
